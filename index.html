      <h1>What I've Done Previously and What I Can Offer</h1>
      <p>Below this is a list of the various websites I've worked on in the past, my prior experience and work if you will. I've poured hours of hard work into each to make sure they came out perfect, and I think I did a really good job of it, but hey, I can always learn more and that's why I'm here in these classes, to learn more and become even better.</p>
